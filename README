Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window sub-tree.

The Byzi extension for Tk provides a simple means to
block keyboard, button and pointer events from Tk widgets, while
overriding the widget's cursor with a configurable busy cursor.

The Byzi extension is based on the Tk 8.6.6 busy command sources.
